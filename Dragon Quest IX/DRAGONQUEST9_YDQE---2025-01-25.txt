This is an export which includes 10hrs playtime
since 2025-01-02. We exported it mainly in order
to load the save into DeSmuME. Some investigation
later, it works!

DeSmuME apparently recognizes the kind of save
file in part based on the file extension.
We did not need to change the contents of the
file at all (i.e. we didn't need to convert it
between save formats online). However, we did
need to change the .dsv extension to .sav.
Then it imported into DeSmuME correctly, via
File > Import ROM Save File... (v0.9.13 macOS)
or File > Import Backup Memory (v0.9.13 Windows).
