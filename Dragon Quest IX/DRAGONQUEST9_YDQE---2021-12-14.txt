We have no idea why Finder disagrees here!!
We're pretty sure we just copied the file
over basically right before writing this
text file, and yet the date modified is
somehow something else.

We're assuming the date created, consistent
between the microSD drive and our SSD, is
correct. It's certainly not from all the way
back in 2018-12-24, because we *have* a file
from right about then, and it has 100 fewer
in-game play hours.
