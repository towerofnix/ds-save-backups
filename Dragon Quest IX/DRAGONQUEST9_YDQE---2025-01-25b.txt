We passed 600 hours playtime! Yay!

This save file includes playtime using TKG_DQ9's
"Random Battlefield in Grottoes" lua script,
which can only be run in the Windows build of
DeSmuME.

These are our DeSmuME configuration settings:
Config > Frame Skip > 0 (never skip)
Config > Frame Skip > Limit framerate
Config > Display Method > OpenGL
Config > Emulation Settings > all default
  (Enable Advanced Bus-Level Timing: on)
  (Enable Game Hacks: on)
  (Use dynamic recompiler: off)
Config > Sound Settings > Dual SPU Synch/Async
Config > 3D Settings > GPU Scaling Factor: 1 or 2
  (According to preference. 1 does seem to run
   smoother and reflects in-game graphics more
   accurately to developers' intention, which
   is nice for the randomized backgrounds.
   But upscaling is always cool.)

We did not configure the key/button mapping,
because Config > Control Config crashes (lol).
As a refresher on the defaults:
  kbd X -> btn A
  kbd Z -> btn B
  kbd S -> btn X
  kbd A -> btn Y
