The save location is Angel Falls, and this is from
the same day as some monster hunting research we did
for this page:
http://dqnine.wikidot.com/monsters-around-angel-falls

When we came back a couple months later to our mini-
bestiary, which tracks how many we've beat of each
monster, we ended up reducing a bunch of numbers we'd
recorded for the monsters around Angel Falls. We forgot
that our actual DS was where we'd played most recently!

That means this save file is a split-off timeline and
just cuts right here.
